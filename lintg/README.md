The lingt.ipynb Notebook demonstrates how we can compute trends and uncertainties on temperature data to see how sensitive those trends are to starting and ending dates. To do so, we can look at GISTEMP v3 data, which is global-mean, monthly-mean temperature estimates based on land-surface air temperature anomalies.

A helper method file is included as process_gsse_global_tempy.py, although I have currently included all necessary methods in the Notebook itself. Also, an image used for illustration purposes in the Notebook is called example_trends.png. If you want to download the data for yourself, it was retrieved from [here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/).
