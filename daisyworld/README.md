Welcome to Daisyworld! This Notebook is modelled after a program called `daisy.m` written by Dennis Hartmann at the University of Washington. It models the computer simulation described in Watson and Lovelock, 1983, Biological homeostasis of the global environment: [The Parable of Daisyworld](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3402/tellusb.v35i4.14616), Tellus, 35B,  284-289.

Daisyworld is a computer simulation that looks to show that the [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) is plausible. That is, living organisms interact with their environment in a way that regulates and stabilizes that environment, thus perpetuating the conditions needed to support life on a planet. In this simulation, the only two kinds of living organisms are black and white daisies. White daisies have a high albedo and so reflect sunlight, while the black daisies absorb light and heat. We can then track how these two types of daisies compete for resources and affect the surface temeprature of the Earth.
